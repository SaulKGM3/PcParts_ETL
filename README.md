# PcParts_ETL
This project demonstrates a practical ETL process using synthetic data, showing each step from CSV data preparation and cleaning to transformation, consolidation, and loading into SQL, with a final Power BI dashboard for illustration.

**Note**: The main goal is to illustrate a complete ETL workflow, not to generate business insights from real data.

## Project structure
- **ETL Notebook**
Contains the full code for data cleaning, transformation, and loading. Personal info is anonymized.

- **Dashboard**
Includes images of the Power BI dashboard illustrating the output stage of the ETL process.

## Workflow overview

To illustrate the ETL workflow, here is a quick visual summary:

1 Raw CSV data
2 Processing and cleaning in Python notebook
3 Tables loaded into SQL
4 Dashboarding in Power BI

## Notes and pending improvements

- This is a work in progress.

- The notebook currently contains comments in Spanish; this will be switched to English soon for clarity.

- Synthetic data will be further optimized for more realistic behavior and distribution.

- The code is fully functional but will be refactored for better structure and readability.
